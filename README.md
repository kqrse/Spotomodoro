## Yes, you do need a premium Spotify account

No, you can't just use mine.

## Environment Variables

You'll need to setup a Spotify Developer account and create a Spotify Application to get your own Spotify Client ID and Spotify Client Secret. Do so here: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/

Create an .env file with the following:

`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='<your client id>'`

`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='<your client secret>'`
